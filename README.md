================================

Epicodus Week 4 Day 2 Projects

*To do list*
Follow along with last night's lesson and refactor the To Do list.

*Address book*
Make an address book for users to store contact information about people they know. You'll start with a very basic application and then add several layers of functionality.

Here's what you should build, in order:

Add contacts with just a name, phone number, email, and mailing address.
List out the contacts' names.
Choose a contact to view all of the information about it.
Add multiple phones, emails, and addresses to each contact. Hint: make classes for Phone, Email, and Address.
Allow contacts to be edited.
Let contacts be deleted.
